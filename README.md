# Predicting-House-Prices
In this notebook, I explore various regression methods to predict house prices. Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the goal is to compare their performance.
I think regression is one of the most important methods because it gives us more insight about the data. When we ask why, it is easier to interpret the relation between the response and explanatory variables.
I start with a very simple model and continue with more complex ones after visualizing some features and a data mining process. I try to find the best regression for this dataset.

On the other hand, if you are looking for more theory and do not want to use built in functions, I recommend you to check my other kernel k-NN, Logistic Regression, k-Fold CV from Scratch.
